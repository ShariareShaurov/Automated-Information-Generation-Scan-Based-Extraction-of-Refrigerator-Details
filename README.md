# Automated-Information-Generation-Scan-Based-Extraction-of-Refrigerator-Details
The main objective of this project is to create an automated system that generates information for all SINGER Refrigerators prepared for market distribution by scanning barcodes printed over it. My model proficiently identifies the refrigerator model name, version number, and glass color. Moreover, it can measure scanning time, track individual model, and Tully the total number of scanned refrigerators. Most important feature of my model is that it can autometicaly generate necessery informations in a excel sheet and also it can recognize repeated scanning errors which ensures one time scanning of a unique barcode level.
