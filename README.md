# Automated-Information-Generation-Scan-Based-Extraction-of-Refrigerator-Details
The main objective of this project is to create an automated system that generates information for all SINGER Refrigerators prepared for market distribution by scanning barcodes printed over them. My model proficiently identifies the refrigerator model name, version number, and glass color. Moreover, it can measure scanning time, track individual models, and Tully the total number of scanned refrigerators. The most important feature of my model is that it can automatically generate necessary information in an Excel sheet. Also, it can recognize repeated scanning errors which ensures one-time scanning of an individual barcode level.
